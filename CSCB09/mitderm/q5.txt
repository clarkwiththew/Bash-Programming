a) Sizeof s= 5*8+2*5=40+10=50
Sizeof lingling= size of the largest type = 5*8=40

B)
What is the type of q? double *

 What
is the type of y?
t

C)wrong because getchar() returns an int, not a char. Cannot assign char c to int output of getchar().

D)This is run with stdin redirected from an empty file. It mistakenly reports “not empty”.
Help the beginner by briefly answering: Why is this approach ineffective? And what is
a correct approach?
Not effective because it reads a file stream. 
feof:
This function returns a non-zero value when End-of-File indicator associated with the stream is set, else zero is returned.

We do not have an eof, so this function does not know when there is end of file, so zero is returned.

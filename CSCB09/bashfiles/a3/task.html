<h1>CSCB09 2020 Summer Assignment 3</h1>

<p>Due: Sunday August 2 2020 midnight

<p>This assignment is worth 12%.

<p>In this assignment, you will practice making child processes, exec'ing other
programs, and connecting child processes with pipes.

<p>As usual, you should aim for reasonably efficient algorithms and reasonably
organized, comprehensible code.


<h2>Process Substitution</h2>

<p>bash has a convenient extra feature “process substitution” not in sh. In the
simplest form it goes:

<pre>
command1 &lt;(command2 args)
</pre>

<p>command1 will see a command line argument. We users don't see it, but
command1 does. Let's call it F because I need to refer to it later. Normally,
command1 treats F as a filename and open it for reading (only).

<p>Normally, command2 writes data to stdout. Here is the magical part: Whenever
command1 reads from “file” F, it sees data from command2's stdout!

<p>Many students used this feature to evade learning a required topic. The prof
is not pleased. The prof's revenge is to make you implement this feature so you
have a harder topic to learn!

<p>(On the bright side, haven't you always wondered how bash pulls off this
trick?)


<h3>A Discovery (optional, not graded)</h3>

<p>Write a shell script or C program that prints the command line arguments it
sees. It doesn't actually need to read any file. Use it as command1. This is to
discover the secret F to help find out what's going on. Example bash command:

<pre>
./yourprog &lt;(echo hello)
</pre>

<p>What do you find? What do you think it means?


<h3>Theory</h3>

<p>/dev/fd is a special directory (not on real disk) provided/emulated by the
kernel. Whenever a process P looks into it, P finds numeric filenames, and the
numbers are exactly P's current open file descriptors. And if P reads from, say,
/dev/fd/0, it's equivalent to reading from file descriptor 0.

<p>(Naturally, different processes see different content, since the kernel is
making it up on the fly, tailor-made to the process that asks.)

<p>With this friendly service from the kernel, bash can pull off its trick.  (It
is still a pipe.)  We assume that command1 and command2 are executable program
pathnames in this assignment, even though bash is much more flexible than that.

<ol>
  <li><p>Create a pipe. Let's say the read-end FD is 42, write-end FD is 43, for
    the sake of concreteness, but this is just an example.

  <li><p>Create a child process for command1. Exec command1 with command line
    argument /dev/fd/42 (the secret F above).

  <li><p>Create another child process for command2. Use dup2 to redirect
    stdout to the write end of the pipe, before exec'ing.

  <li><p>All 3 processes should also close certain unneeded file descriptors, as
    discussed in the lecture concerning pipe hygiene. It is your job to figure
    out which and when.
</ol>


<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>The function you will implement (in procsub.c) is:

<pre>
int procsub(const char *prog1, const char *prog2, char *prog2_argv[], int status[])
</pre>

<p><code>prog1</code> is the pathname for command1. That program expects a
filename argument, and will read that file. (<code>execlp</code> is a good way
to exec it.) It may still do other things: use stdin, stdout, stderr, other
files.

<p><code>prog2</code> is the pathname for command2. That program will write data
to stdout.  It may still do other things: use stdin, stderr, other files.

<p><code>prog2_argv</code> are the arguments for prog2. (It is set up so that
you can't go wrong with a simple <code>execvp(prog2, prog2_argv)</code>.)

<p>The function should do the steps outlined in the theory section above. In
addition:

<p>The parent should wait for both children to terminate, and store the wait
statuses in the <code>status</code> array (the last parameter).
<code>status[0]</code> is for prog1, <code>status[1]</code> is for prog2.

<p>The function, run as parent, should return 0 if all of the above tasks for
the parent are successful and done.


<h3>Error handling</h3>

<p>Parent: If <code>pipe</code> or <code>fork</code> fails, return -1
immediately.

<p>Either child: If exec fails, exit with exit code 37. Error message is up
to you, but send any to stderr.

<p>Other errors: You may ignore or handle, your choice.  If you handle, send any
error message to stderr, and parent returns -1, child exits with exit code 37.
